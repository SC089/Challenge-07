  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description
  This application will ask the user some questions, the user will answer those questions, and then the application will take those answers and generate an entire readme file.

  ## Installation
  ```
  npm install
  ```

  ## Usage
  ```
  To use this application, you will be asked a few questions such as the title and description of your project. When you answer these questions the application will generate a readme file for your project, that way you can spend less time writing a readme and spend more time coding.
  ```

  ## Contribution
  ```
  You can add the option to go back to a previous question, better format the generated readme file, or add the option to skip a question.

  ## Tests
  ```
  Launch the application and simply answer the questions, once you answer the questions, you will then see your answers being used to generate a readme file. If you continue to use the application, you will see that the new answers will overwrite the old ones.
